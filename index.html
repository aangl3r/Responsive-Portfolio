            <p>My name is Justin Chastain - Welcome to my page! What you have stumbled upon is the first Portfolio-style
                website I have ever created in my coding career. Hopefully it doesn't 404!</p>

            <p>I am 25 years old and have been 25 years old for almost an entire year. I own a house and in my home to
                protect myself from the cold. However, inside my home I have another home where I keep things to protect
                them from the heat! I also keep two different species of mammals in my home, both of which I have
                trained into submission. One is small, orange, and spends most of his time sleeping. The other is quite
                large and doesn't know how to move from one location to another at any speed other than her maximum
                attainable velocity.</p>

            <p>I afford these things by depriving myself of sleep and fun in order to attend a daily obligation where I
                travel to another location an hour away to type numbers on a portable computer for people hundreds of
                miles away. In return, every two weeks a number on a different website goes up, which lets me know I can
                continue to eat food and ward off those who have traded expensive goods to me.</p>

            <p>Every five days, I'm allowed to do as I please for two days in a row! On these days I like to meet with
                other humans who are in a similar situation and consume fermented fruits and vegetables to make myself
                more talkative. This usually works. I also enjoy sitting in the rooms of my home and watching pixels
                change on a screen, or better yet, controlling how the pixels change.</p>

            <p>I hope you've learned a great deal about me! If you'd like to know more, feel free to check out my work
                in my Portfolio as well as other contact information via the links above.</p>

            <p>Thank you!</p>
