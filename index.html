                                In 2019 I decided to expand my education and attended Georgia Tech's Full Stack Flex web
                                development bootcamp. 24 weeks of intensive class time, study, practice, and projects
                                taught
                                me skills such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, C#, Bootstrap, Node.js, NPM,
                                React.js, Express.js,
                                MongoDB, MySQL, Git and GitHub Collaboration, Heroku Deployment, and that the answer to
                                "Is this
                                possible?" is <i>always</i> yes, and that answer is on Google... somewhere. See the

                                I attended Georgia State University for undergrad and earned a BBA in Actuarial Science.
                                I was
                                awarded the Presidential Scholarship (the highest academic scholarship offered by GSU),
                                fulfilled
                                the Honors College requirements, and remained on the Dean's list for all semesters of my
                                degree
                                program. As a result of entering college with significant credit from advanced placement
                                courses
                                in high school, I was able to finish my degree program 2 semesters early in May 2014.

                                During my time at GSU, I worked as a research assistant in several capacities including
                                data entry,
                                proctor assistant, test administrator, and study supervisor. I also served in an

                                capacity during sessions where the team would design the tests for data collection.
                                Examples of this research
                                include: studies on Graphene Synthesis; prenatal decision making in Rwanda, Uganda, and
                                Zimbabwe; decision

                                In college I worked as a research assistant in various capacities for 3 years (see
                                above),
                                and also a delivery driver for Pizza Hut. During my last year of school I interned at a
                                Financial Planning firm called Reynolds & Reynolds Financial Partners and learned about
                                personal finance, interacting with clients,
                                investments and insurance, and many other topics. I obtained the licenses required and
                                continued employment here until moving into Corporate Finance in early 2015.

                                Graphic Packaging International hired me as a Financial Analyst and I performed

                                such as reporting, planning, forecasting, and variance commentary. I was also
                                responsible
                                for tracking several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for strategic analysis. I left

                                As part of the Facilities Maintenance business unit at HD Supply, I was tasked with
                                revamping the CapEx process front to back. This required designing a process that would
                                run smoothly with scalability, and procuring the tools such a process would have.
                                Eventually,
                                this involved bringing internal SharePoint developers to create submission forms, hiring
                                professional consultants to configure SAP's Fixed Asset Module appropriately, and
                                training
                                users on the new process and functions. By the end of my time at HD Supply a fully
                                functional
                                internal SharePoint site handled all requests, approval steps, and hooked into financial
                                systems
                                for tracking and reporting. My role also included reporting and forecasting of P&L
                                financials, KPI
                                tracking, and strategic analysis for various metrics.

                                In late 2017 I joined Elavon, a payments acquirer owned by U.S. Bank. Initially my role
                                focused on automating and improving the FP&A team's existing reporting as well as
                                producing
                                mini-P&Ls for numerous and frequent small projects. Roughly 5 months in, I was pulled
                                into
                                preparing a massive business case for presentation to U.S. Bank, which they eventually
                                approved.
                                The influx of capital from this approval was unprecedented for Elavon and a separate
                                Finance department
                                was created,
                                with me as a Finance Manager. The size of the investment essentially created a mid-sized
                                software
                                development shop ($55M of capital labor annually), as well as the support
                                infrastructure, marketing,
                                and sales resources needed to make the most bang. All of this needed its own detailed
                                tracking, which
                                we (the finance director and myself) were to provide.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                Early and mid-2018 had me focused on creating the reporting and support functions needed
                                for
                                business owners to make good decisions while staffing up and breaking ground on new
                                products.
                                Once automated tracking was set up, I focused on creating more detailed and actionable
                                tools
                                directed at problem areas. Meanwhile our department's scope increases as Elavon makes
                                several
                                acquisitions of smaller acquirers. These required their own capital and business cases
                                for justificaton.
                                Now, and moving forward, my role will focus on integrating automated reporting into
                                "business as
                                usual," and also improving processes for project prioritization as Elavon fully
                                transitions into Agile.

                                A prior manager once told
                                me, "Some people come to work to serve a function, and that's okay. Others come to run a
                                business.
                                It's completely your choice, but only one will build a career." Throughout school and in
                                my working life I have always sought the blueprint for doing better,
                                learning more, and working efficiently. Following this has allowed me to produce the
