                                My name is Justin Chastain - Welcome to my page! What you have stumbled upon is the
                                first Portfolio-style website I have ever created in my coding career. Hopefully it
                                doesn't
                                404!

                                I am 26 years old and own a house. I stay in my home to protect myself from the cold.
                                However, inside my home I have another home where I keep things to protect them from the
                                heat! I
                                also keep two different species of mammals in my home, both of which I have trained into
                                submission. One is small, orange, and spends most of his time sleeping. The other is
                                quite large and
                                doesn't know how to move from one location to another at any speed other than her
                                maximum
                                attainable velocity.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                I afford these things by depriving myself of sleep and fun in order to attend a daily
                                obligation where I travel to another location an hour away to type numbers on a portable
                                computer
                                for people hundreds of miles away. In return, every two weeks a number on a different
                                website goes up, which lets me know I can continue to eat food and ward off those who
                                have traded
                                expensive goods to me.

                                Every five days, I'm allowed to do as I please for two days in a row! On these days I
                                like to meet with other humans who are in a similar situation and consume fermented
                                fruits and
                                vegetables to make myself more talkative. This usually works. I also enjoy sitting in
                                the rooms of my home and watching pixels change on a screen, or better yet, controlling
                                how the
                                pixels change.
